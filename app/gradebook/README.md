# Gradebook Implementation

This document explains the key implementation choices and architecture of the Gradebook module.

## Architecture Overview

The Gradebook module follows a server-client architecture:

1. **Server Component (`page.tsx`)**: Handles authentication, role-based access control, and initial data fetching.I'll update and improve the Gradebook platform to fully integrate attendance and provide comprehensive grade management capabilities as requested. Let's implement these features:

First, let's update the gradebook client component to integrate attendance and improve the overall structure:

## Architecture Decisions

### TanStack Table
We chose TanStack Table (formerly React Table) for the gradebook implementation because:
- It provides excellent performance with large datasets through virtualization
- It has built-in support for sorting, filtering, and pagination
- It's headless by design, allowing us to use our own UI components
- It has TypeScript support out of the box

### Form Validation
For form validation, we use React Hook Form with Zod because:
- React Hook Form is performant and minimizes re-renders
- Zod provides type-safe schema validation
- The combination allows for easy form state management and validation
- Error messages are automatically handled and displayed

### Role-Based Access Control
The gradebook page is protected using server-side role checks:
1. We check for a valid session using Supabase Auth
2. We verify the user has either a "teacher" or "admin" role
3. If either check fails, we redirect to the appropriate page
4. This ensures security is enforced at the server level, not just in the UI

## Data Flow

1. Server Component (`page.tsx`):
   - Authenticates the user and checks permissions
   - Fetches initial data from Supabase
   - Passes data to the Client Component

2. Client Component (`client.tsx`):
   - Manages UI state (selected class, period, etc.)
   - Handles user interactions
   - Renders the UI components

3. Grade Table Component:
   - Uses TanStack Table to manage the table state
   - Handles sorting, filtering, and pagination
   - Provides inline editing capabilities

## Performance Considerations

- We use `useMemo` to avoid unnecessary recalculations
- Data fetching is optimized to only happen when necessary
- The table uses virtualization for handling large datasets
- We implement pagination to limit the amount of data rendered at once

## Accessibility

- All interactive elements have proper ARIA attributes
- The table has proper semantic markup
- Color contrast meets WCAG standards
- Keyboard navigation is fully supported
